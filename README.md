🚀 Sales Performance Dashboard – Multi-City Comparison 📊

I recently created this interactive Sales & Target Achievement Dashboard to analyze team performance across cities including Chennai, Mumbai, Nagpur, Pune, Ranchi, and others.

🔍 Key Insights: ✅ City-wise breakdown of Total Sales
✅ Target Hit % and Gap analysis
✅ Individual contributor performance
✅ Visual highlights with bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs

💡 What can we learn from this dashboard?

Which teams are hitting their targets, and where is improvement needed?

Who are the top performers by city?

How far are some team members from achieving their goals?


🎯 This kind of dashboard can help Sales Leaders, Team Managers, and Business Analysts:

Identify coaching needs

Set realistic targets

Drive performance-based decisions


📌 Built using Excel Pivot Tables + Charts
📌 Simple, visual, and easy to communicate performance metrics!
